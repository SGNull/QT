An overall improvement to the QPU. No longer single-instruction, no longer IC-less. More power and ease-of-use.


New special instructions bit format:

Bits 7 - 4		Bits 3-2			Bits 1-0
===========		================	====================
1 [!HLT] 00		[SWP, FLG, B, A]	[B-A, A+B, A-B, CLF]  < FLG
									[B-1, B+1, -B, CLB]  < B
									[A-1, A+1, -A, CLB]  < A
